# Hammer Language Changer

>A Valve Hammer Editor modification to set it's language to Spanish (Castellano). It also changes some dialog layouts to make them better looking.
>
>Currently only works for **Portal 2 SDK**, more games could be added in a future.
>Sadly, I couldn't translate the entire program, because some strings are inside the `.exe`, wich cannot be modified. But almost the entire thing is properly translated.
