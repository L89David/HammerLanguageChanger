# Hammer Language Changer

A Valve Hammer Editor modification change it's language.

>**Available Languages:**  
> * Spanish - DarviL  
> * French (In development) - Orinji Nejo  
> * Original - Valve  

Currently only works for **Portal 2 SDK**, more games could be added in a future.  
Sadly, it's not possible to translate the entire program, because some strings are inside the `.exe`, wich cannot be modified. But almost the entire thing can be properly translated.
