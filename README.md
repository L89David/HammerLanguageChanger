# HammerSpanish
A Valve Hammer editor modification to set the program language to Spanish (Castellano)
Currently only works for Portal 2 SDK, more games could be possible in a future.
Sadly, I couldn't translate the entire program, because some strings are inside the `.exe`, wich cannot be modified. But almost the entire thing is properly translated.


# How to install
In order to install this you only have to move the `hammer_dll.dll` to the `Portal 2/bin` folder. Make sure Hammer is closed while doing this.

# How to uninstall
To uninstall you can do the same process as the install part, but with the original dll file provided, or remove the dll and verify the SDK files.
