***A Valve Hammer Editor modification to change it's language.***

Currently only works for **Portal 2 SDK**, more games could be added in a future.  
Sadly, it's not possible to translate the entire program, because some strings are inside the `.exe`, wich cannot be modified. But almost the entire thing can be properly translated.

Would you like to translate Hammer to to your language? Help us to do so!
